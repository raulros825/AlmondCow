Not to mention, you’ll be left with the remaining almond pulp, which has many uses. If you made oat milk in your Almond Cow, the savings would be closer to 90% or higher. Keep in mind you can use any combination of nuts, seeds, grains, oats, which allows you to control the price of whatever plant-based milk you decide to make.
